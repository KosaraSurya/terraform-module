# terraform-module
I am practicing terraform module here

Trainer shiva created two repos for practiccing modules those are
1.roboshop-ec2-test, 2.terraform-aws-instance in his git https://github.com/daws-84s

Here i was created terraform-module in that i was created 2 directories as
1.roboshop-ec2-test, 2.terraform-aws-instance

But in my practice notes i was mentioned as terraform-ec2-test in place of roboshop-ec2-test
